			<h1>Is the self our 'self'?</h1>
			<p>Not only do we imagine that we have a 'self', we also believe it is the same 'self' as it was yesterday, as it was 5 years ago, as it was when we were born. But is it? It would be naive to imagine parts of our 'self' don't change. Are you exactly the same as you were when you were an infant? Has your understanding of the world changed? Have your expectations? Have you come to see your place in this world as markedly different than it was when you were imagining the vastness of the cosmos contained within your nursery walls? And so we change, if only bit by bit. And so we enter the realm of the Ship of Theseus paradox. At what point does a thing being replaced in stages cease to be the original thing and become a new thing altogether? If you change the head of an axe, is it the same axe? If you then change the hilt? Here the inadequacy of human reasoning is presented with a challenge. Is it simply that our nomenclature is too inflexible to contain something as fluid as the 'self', as life itself? One cannot indeed step in the same river twice if that river is defined by its unique contents, by the molecules of water it contains, the driftwood, the shape of the sands that clothe its bed. Only when encapsulated by the great abstraction of human classification can we see it as whole and immutable. But our investigation into the 'self' is not meant to retreat into abstraction, but to lay bear the observed nature of our beings. Davd Hume imagines us as a bundle of competing identities, perspectives, and demands, perpetually in flux and subject to rejuvenation and replacement. Much like the Ship of Theseus, it is the overall aspect of the thing and not it's contents that can be named and maintained. But defining the self as an aggregate still does not offer satisfying resolution to the question that truly vexes us above all: is it our 'self'?</p>

			<p class="highlighted">Perhaps the question we should be concerning ourselves with above all is instead, does it matter? Is our self a thing, inviolable and sacred or is it a tool by which we conceptualize and manifest our relationship with the world around us? Is the self our center of gravity, our core understanding of the world that we inhabit so briefly, our light in the darkness as we grope blindly through our days? Or is it simply an illusion? Are we in no way discrete from our environment? Are we the darkness, the light, and the blind groper in one?</p>

			<p>If these questions have wrested you from sleep on more than one occasion then perhaps our quiz offers you the best of both worlds: a chance to ask the important questions and the nonsensical ones, as well as to receive answers that are both fitting and completely inane. It is by any measure, a pure summation of the history of human self-contemplation. So, let's find out together what you really are, and is it contagious?</p>
